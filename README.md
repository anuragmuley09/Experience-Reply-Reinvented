# Experience-Replay-Reinvented



## Overview

*Experience-Replay-Reinvented* is a C++ project hosted on GitHub. The repository appears to focus on implementing features related to binary search trees (BST) and logging mechanisms. While the repository lacks a detailed description, the included files suggest its primary purpose is to explore and demonstrate concepts in C++ programming.



## Features

- *Binary Search Tree Implementation*: Includes BST.cpp and BST.hpp, which likely contain the logic for creating and managing binary search trees.

- *Experience Management*: The Experience.hpp file suggests functionality for handling experiences, possibly related to data or user interactions.

- *Logging System*: The Logger.hpp file indicates the presence of a logging mechanism for tracking events or debugging information.

- *Main Application*: The main.cpp file serves as the entry point for the program, integrating various components.



## File Structure

The repository contains the following files:

- .vscode/: Configuration files for Visual Studio Code.

- .editorconfig: Editor configuration settings.

- BST.cpp and BST.hpp: Implementation and header files for binary search tree functionality.

- Experience.hpp: Header file related to experience management.

- Logger.hpp: Header file for logging mechanisms.

- main.cpp: Main program file.

- main.exe: Compiled executable.
